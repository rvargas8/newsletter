First, worker bees fly from flower to flower collecting nectar, which is a sugary liquid found deep inside flowers. They use their long tongues to suck up the nectar and store it in a special stomach called a honey stomach. A single bee might visit up to 100 flowers on just one trip!", 19),
            ("Back at the hive, the bees pass the nectar to other bees who chew it for about 30 minutes. While chewing, they add special chemicals called enzymes from their bodies that begin to change the nectar into honey. Then they spread the nectar into six-sided cells in the honeycomb.", 43),
            ("The bees fan their wings really fast to help water evaporate from the nectar, making it thicker and thicker. It can take the nectar from two million flowers to make just one pound of honey!

It starts when an adult female butterfly carefully lays tiny eggs on a leaf, usually choosing a plant that caterpillars like to eat. After a few days or weeks, a small caterpillar hatches from the egg and immediately begins its job: eating! The caterpillar munches on leaves constantly, growing bigger and bigger.", 24),
            ("As it grows, it sheds its tight skin several times. When the caterpillar is fully grown, it finds a safe spot and forms a hard shell called a chrysalis around itself. It hangs upside down and stays very still. Inside the chrysalis, something magical happens. The caterpillar's body actually breaks down into a soupy liquid, and then rebuilds itself into a completely different form.", 57),
            ("After one to four weeks, depending on the type of butterfly, a beautiful adult butterfly breaks out of the chrysalis with wet, crumpled wings. The butterfly hangs on its old chrysalis and pumps special fluid from its body into its wings to make them expand and become strong. Once its wings dry and harden in the sun, the butterfly can fly away to find flowers, drink nectar, and eventually start the cycle all over again by laying eggs of its own.", 100)

This melted rock is called magma when it's still underground and lava when it flows out onto the surface. Volcanoes form in places where Earth's rocky outer shell, called the crust, is weak or cracked.", 18),
            ("Deep beneath the surface, temperatures are so hot that rock melts into a thick, glowing liquid. When pressure builds up beneath the Earth's crust, it pushes the magma upward through cracks and weak spots until it erupts out of the volcano. When a volcano erupts, it can shoot out lava, clouds of ash, chunks of rock, poisonous gases, and even lightning!", 44),
            ("Some volcanic eruptions are quiet and gentle, with lava slowly oozing down the sides of the mountain like thick syrup. Other eruptions are explosive and very dangerous, sending ash miles into the sky and destroying everything nearby. Not all volcanoes erupt all the time. Scientists put volcanoes into three groups. Active volcanoes erupt regularly or have erupted recently and could erupt again soon. Dormant volcanoes haven't erupted in a long time but still could erupt again someday. Extinct volcanoes will probably never erupt again because they no longer have magma beneath them.", 93),

This cycle has been happening for billions of years and is the reason we have fresh water to drink. It starts when the sun heats up water in oceans, lakes, rivers, and even puddles. The heat causes the water to turn into an invisible gas called water vapor that rises into the air. This process is called evaporation.", 24),
            ("Water also evaporates from plants through tiny holes in their leaves. As the water vapor rises higher and higher into the atmosphere, it gets colder because the air is cooler up high. When water vapor gets cold enough, it changes back into tiny liquid water droplets. This process is called condensation. Millions and millions of these tiny droplets come together to form clouds that you can see floating in the sky.", 58),
            ("The droplets in the clouds bump into each other and stick together, growing bigger and bigger. When the droplets become too heavy to float in the air anymore, they fall back down to Earth. This falling water is called precipitation, and it can happen as rain, snow, sleet, or hail depending on how cold the air is. When precipitation reaches the ground, some of it soaks into the soil where plant roots can use it. The rest flows into streams and rivers, eventually returning to the ocean where the whole amazing cycle begins again.", 102)

Pressure and energy build up at the edges where they're stuck, kind of like when you bend a stick until it snaps.", 56),

The place underground where the earthquake starts is called the focus, and the place on the surface directly above it is called the epicenter.", 91),
